# Solutions

This repository provides solutions for backend development, machine learning data processing, and web scraping tasks. Below is a breakdown of the project structure and the corresponding tasks.

- The src folder contains the solution for the backend task, and the environment setup is specified in the pom.xml file.

- The two Jupyter notebooks include the code for the other two tasks. Users can execute the cells sequentially to obtain the results.

Thank you to the company for giving me the opportunity to take this test.
